\StartLetter{}{Dear editors of {\em Statistical Methods in Medical Research},}

We are submitting another revision of the manuscript ``Cross-validation approaches for penalized Cox regression'' for your consideration to be published in \emph{Statistical Methods in Medical Research}.

The revisions here are relatively modest -- both reviewers were happy with the paper, although reviewer \#1 pointed out some places where clarifications that could be made and inconsistencies addressed. These have all been addressed now.

Thank you very much for your consideration of this revised manuscript.
